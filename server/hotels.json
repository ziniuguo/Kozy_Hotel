Being a part of the Integrated Resort, there are 3 main attractions: Universal Studios Singapore, FestiveWalk and Marine Life Park and a casino. The décor in Starz Restaurant, an all-day buffet restaurant, features an eclectic collection of rock 'n' roll memorabilia, although its menu of classic and contemporary Asian and international flavours is what really rocks.
